# Why Zilp-Zalp?

 Contact tracing should not be a business model. Contact tracing
software with personal data should be designed for the common good and operated without commercial interests. It should be strictly assessed in advance whether such contact tracing is necessary at all.

Zilp-Zalp is an **open source**, **freely usable** software system for **digital-analog** contact tracing. It was designed with **Privacy By Design & Default** principles and systematically minimizes risks for data subjects whose data is processed.

Zilp-Zalp can be very easily operated in a **decentralized** and **federated** manner, data can be stored in a **fail-safe** and **redundant** manner. Zilp-Zalp is the only contact tracking system that implements **strong cryptographic earmarking of** data. In addition, Zilp-Zalp systematically minimizes opportunities for meta-data collection and analysis. We are convinced that Zilp-Zalp is the most privacy-friendly and secure contact tracking software system.
